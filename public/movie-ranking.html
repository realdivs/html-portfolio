<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>I have seen this movie almost 20-30 times and if you ask me to watch it again then also I will be ready to watch it. It never gets old
    that is the magic of this movie. It always leaves a smile on my face.<br />
    Year : 2009

<h3>Jab We Met</h3>
<p>This movie is very close to my heart beacuse it has the love-story that we all want to manifest in our real-life. Kareena's performance
    in this movie is just OP and she gives a lot of expressions and is very much into the role of 'GEET'. P.S. : She is one of my favourite 
    heroines as well.<br />
    Year : 2007

<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>When I was a kid I found this movie very much funny as this movie is surely GOAT(Greatest Of All Time). This movie is a masterpiece.
   Akshay Kumar's acting was top-level in this movie as a main lead in the movie.<br />
   Year : 2007
